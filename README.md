# Exonova-clone-static-full

Static HTML/CSS/JS template (Scientific Modern) — ready for GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1. Clone or download this folder.
2. Edit content and images in `assets/images` and the HTML files.
3. Initialize a git repo and push to GitHub (see GitHub docs).
4. Enable GitHub Pages: Go to your repository → Settings → Pages → Choose branch `main` and `/ (root)` → Save.

## Formspree
The contact form in `contact.html` uses Formspree. Replace `your_form_id` in the form `action` URL with your actual Formspree form ID to receive messages via email.

## Notes
- Images use `https://picsum.photos` placeholders — replace with real images in `assets/images` if you prefer local assets.
- This project is intentionally lightweight (no build step) to simplify GitHub Pages hosting.
